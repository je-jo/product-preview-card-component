## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Observations

- Had trouble making equal width columns with flexbox, because of one element's padding. See useful resources below.


### Useful resources

- [My Basic Template](https://github.com/je-jo/basic-template) pretty much based on Stephanie Eckless' [HTML / Sass Jumpstart](https://github.com/5t3ph/html-sass-jumpstart) but much simpler;
- [Equal Columns With Flexbox: Itâ€™s More Complicated Than You Might Think](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/) - If only some of the columns have padding, the cleanest flexbox solution is to nest the element with the padding on it.

## Acknowledgments

- [Solution by Julio Cinquina](https://github.com/JulioCinquina/fem-product-preview-card) - A fellow learner presented a solution to an accessibility issue that I wasn't even aware of: most screen readers do not describe crossed-out text as such. Solved by including a visually hidden sentence describing the prices, and hiding displayed prices from screen readers.
